A ground sqirrel chewing a cable is one wat this can happen, so is a faulty electronic component, but for a real physical process that generates EM Noise, assuming that it effects only one channel is not realistic. For one thing, E, H are coupled, so it is only plausible that noise in an H would have a corresponding noise in E (Discuss electric fences), and also, it woudl be very lucky if a noise source was so precisely polarized that it coupled into only one of say $H_x$ or $H_y$, more likely it would be in both -- and ditto for electrics.\n",

    "The RR method will still work well for 2 or 3D, BUT STILL ASSUMES that channel noise is uncorrelated with other channel noise to get an unbiased estimate.  So-- N.B. If the noise is not incoherent, i.e. say some channels at either site have noise correlated with noise at the same site, we do not get the friendly cancelations of the previous section, rather the noise contaminates the estimates.  The details of working through that are somewhat algebraically involved, and it is probably better to build a toy model with coherent noise in various channel combinations and look at the bias rather than derive it -- at least for now.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The time series described in Equation 3a are a sequence of observations.  \n",
    "  - Without multiple observations, the solution to Equation 1 is underdetermined. \n",
    "- With noise in the measurements, incoherent or otherwise, we need to apply statistical methods to get TF estimates\n",
    "  - this involved compensation for outliers (leverage points) \n",
    "  - estimates improve as the number of observations increases.  \n",
    "  - Noise sources may be transient and entire blocks of time series may be better discarded than processed\n",
    "- Processing should also consider nothc filtering power-lines or other nearby sources."
