    "# MTH5 Example 07\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make an MTH5 from Phoenix Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to read Phoenix data into an MTH5 file.  These data are provided by Phoenix Geophysical Ltd. Provided are 3 synchronously recored stations.  The Phoenix instruments MTU-5 series are broadband instruments with multiple sample rates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The instrumnet is constantly recording at 24 kHz and depending on the input paramters those data are decimated or chunked into different data files.  A common setup is to record continuously at 150 samples per second and record short bursts of 24 kHz for just a few seconds every 15 minutes or so.  In this case the continuous 24 kHz is decimated down to 150 Hz and stored in files with a length of 6 minutes.  The short bursts are also stored into a separate file.  This is done for each channel recorded.  Its common for broadband instruments to record each channel individually making it easier to buffer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge arises when you have the short bursts is that you will have a ton of runs.  Luckily HDF5 can handle this, we just have to organize it properly.  And figure out which file belongs where.  A `PhoenixCollection` object is provided for just this task. "
