    "We will build an `MTCollection` using `MTpy v2.0`.  Under the hood `MTCollection` is storing the transfer functions in an MTH5 file and using `mt_metadata` to read the transfer functions into a standardize transfer function.  We will also have a look at how to adjust some metadata so that your transfer functions can be nicely organized.  Each of these data sets were collected as different surveys and we will store them as such.  We will go survey by survey loading in the transfer functions.\n",
